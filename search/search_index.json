We have focused on flexibility and ease of development, so if you have a project you want to use sibylla for, but it currently does not have the required capabilities, don't hesitate to email me and we can discuss how to implement and merge it! Similarly you can take a look at the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file.</p>"},{"location":"#name","title":"Name","text":"<p>Why is it called sibylla?</p> <p>Sibylla - Latin for the Sibyl - was Aeneas' guide in his descent into the underworld. She uttered the famous line facilis descensus Averno - the descent to Hell is easy (but coming back is hard!), and warned him about the gate of false visions. It is our goal to make gradient descent image reconstruction easy, and to probabilistically quantify uncertainties and avoid those false visions!</p>"}]}
